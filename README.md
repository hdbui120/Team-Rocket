# Team-Rocket
Development of 400lbf LOX/LCH4 liquid rocket engine by UCD student-led group. This project aim to help us learn more about liquid rocket design and act as a proof of concept rather than a pratical functional one. The final product include finished CAD designs of injector-chamber-nozzle assembly, P&ID diagram, and a technical report.
